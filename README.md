## Installation

The best way to utilize this website would be to access the repository(https://github.com/LuisMtz-0/ShrimpTime) or the deployed pages(https://luismtz-0.github.io/ShrimpTime/) 

## Usage 

To initialize a new entry for time the user would need to select the button next to each section that will allow the user to write inside the text area and once it will clicked again it will save the input data to the local storage with its id that will help localize it.

The timer will display the current time and the js function that will cycle through each div that has a number that will display the color change depending on the current time.
